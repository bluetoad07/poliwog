#### - a 2d game engine written in c -

i guess it's time to start working on this! i don't know how this project will go long term but i'm hoping it turns out well. 

the goal is to create a 2d openGL engine that i can control every aspect of to fine tune it to the needs of my game. 

i will be properly open-sourcing this eventually, once it's in a usable state that is.

i hope future me looks back on this commit one day when the engine is finished.
