### - a 2d game engine written in c -

i guess it's time to start working on this! i don't know how this project will go long term but i'm hoping it turns out well!

the idea is basically a simple 2d openGL engine that is designed with features comparable to that of the snes. this includes color palettes and sequenced music with mml support, as well as some new things that couldn't have been done at the time, like dynamic lighting and normal maps for said lighting.

it will be a while before i can actually start using this to create my game, which is okay because that gives me more time to think of ideas.

very basic roadmap (definitely subject to change, i don't entirely know what i'm doing currently):
- [ ] window creation and resolution scaling
- [ ] bmp sprite rendering with 4bpp indexed color
- [ ] coordinate plane
- [ ] location and subpixel managment.
- [ ] tilesets
- [ ] gui scene editor?
- [ ] a ton more stuff i can't think of right now

i will be properly open-sourcing this eventually, once it's in a usable state that is. that said, this is definitely a project tailor made to my needs as a developer and i don't think many other people will see much practicality in it. but if someone does i want to make sure they can use it too!
